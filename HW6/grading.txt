Problem 3:

* Your stability region boundaries are all perfect.

* Your discussion of the results is very much incorrect.  The shape/size of the boundary is less relevant than the stability _region_ itself; this intimately depends on whether the boundary curve surrounds the _stable_ or _unstable_ regions.  In fact, of these 9 plots, only 4 had shaded region that corresponded to the stable region, while in the other 5 the shaded region was unstable.  To ascertain this, you needed to test some eta value in the plane to see if it satisfied the root condition |r_i| <= delta.


Grading:
* submission: 5/5
* problem 3: 12/15
