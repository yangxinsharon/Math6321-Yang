Problem 4 results:

* Your plots and table of results are excellent.

* I was hoping for a more thorough 'discussion' of your results,
  instead of just saying that some methods were "better".  WHY
  were some methods better?  What do you expect from the long-term
  behavior of using these methods on Hamiltonian systems?

prob4.cpp:

* Your indentation on lines 192 and 193 is off/confusing.

* Otherwise, this file is excellent.

prob4_plots:

* I had to install the 'prettytable' package to run this -- I like
  how nicely it puts tables together!


Grading:
* submission/Makefile: 5/5
* problem 4: 23/25
