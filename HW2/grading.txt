Notes:
* Executables (your .exe and .exe.dSYM files and folders) should almost never be
  added to a Git repository, as these are architecture-dependent (i.e., not portable
  to other computers) and are frequently much larger in size than the source codes
  used to generate them.  I've removed them from your repo; you should refrain from
  adding these in the future.

prob1 results:

* All of your results are excellent, except for your 'overall' convergence rate
  estimate, which is not quite what I expected.

prob1 codes:

* Everything looks great, except I'm struggling to understand what you were doing
  in this calculation of the overall convergence rate.  Given a set of experimental
  data that _should_ adhere to a linear relationship in log-log space, and where you
  only want the slope of this 'line', the most mathematically accurate thing to do is
  a linear-least-squares best fit in log-log space.  You did something completely
  different, overwriting P at each iteration, and just outputting the final value??

* The comment and authorship at the top of your Makefile are inaccurate


prob2 results:

* Wow, your prob2.exe prints a lot of extraneous information to stdout.

* Your first 4 plots are excellent, but I get an error message before your prob2_plots.m
  script can plot the last two:

     Error using importdata (line 139)
     Unable to open file.
     Error in prob2_plots (line 61)
     C = importdata(file2C,delimiterIn,headerlinesIn);

prob2 codes:

* your prob2.cpp can only run ONE of the three required tests.  I explicitly instructed
  you to write a single main() routine that performed all of the experiments, NOT just
  one at a time that requires changes, recompiling, and re-running.

* C++ programs should not use global variables (like you do for both alpha and beta)

* Please delete any unused code instead of commenting out (prob2.cpp lines 82-83)

* Your error in prob2_plots.m is on line 58: your file is named '2c_results.txt', but
  here you wrote '2C_results.txt' -- standard Linux filesystems are case dependent,
  meaning that capitalization is important.


proper submission:  10/10
