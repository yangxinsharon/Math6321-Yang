Notes:
* You should not add compiled executable files to a source code repository.  While the source code itself is 'portable' to other computers, the executables typically are not.


-------------------------

prob2 results:

* Please do not submit codes that require me to input initial guesses.  Your code should be entirely self-contained, and give the results that you intend *no matter what I input as a guess*.

* Your results only appear to be accurate to 11 digits.  This is likely due to printing an insufficient number of digits.

prob2 codes:

* While you do use double precision, you use an overly-coarse tolerance for finding these roots, and only print out 11 total digits (although you ostensibly hold 16).  Due to the quadratic convergence of Newton's method, it is unclear the actual accuracy of your roots (this could be anywhere from 1e-10 to 1e-15).  Typically when we want roots to polynomials, we need these values to be as precise as possible.  I thus strongly prefer that you force tighter tolerances, and print out the full 16-digit results.


prob3 results:

* perfect

prob3 codes:

* I don't understand your use of "R".  You only use it to hold the results from your "vec" solution before printing to the screen -- why not just print X(0) and X(1) instead??

* otherwise, this is perfection


prob2 score: 11/12
prob3 score: 20/20
