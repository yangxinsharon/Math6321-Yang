-------------------------

results: excellent

GeneralizedMidpoint.{hpp,cpp}:

* Nice use of ymid to avoid unnecessary creation/destruction of memory on each call to GMResid::Evaluate and GMResidJac::Evaluate

prob3.cpp:

* It would have been cleaner to create a single GeneralizedMidpoint object and just change its value of theta within a loop over the various theta values.  However, the code is correct.


Grading:
* overall: 10/10
* problem 3: 30/30
